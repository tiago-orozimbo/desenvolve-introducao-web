                <h3>In Ukraine, New American Technology Won the Day. Until It Was Overwhelmed</h3>

                    The idea triggered a full-scale revolt on the <strong>Google campus</strong> .

                    Six years ago, the <em>Silicon Valley</em> giant signed a small, <strong>$9 million</strong> contract to put the skills of a few of its most innovative developers to the task of building an artificial intelligence tool that would help the military detect potential targets on the battlefield using drone footage.

                    <strong>Engineers and other Google employees</strong> argued that the company should have nothing to do with <em>Project Maven</em>, even if it was designed to help the military discern between civilians and militants.

                    The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html">uproar</a> forced the company to back out, but Project Maven didn’t die — it just moved to other contractors. Now, it has grown into an ambitious experiment being tested on the front lines in Ukraine, forming a key component of the U.S. military’s effort to funnel timely information to the soldiers fighting Russian invaders.

                    So far the results are mixed: Generals and commanders have a new way to put a full picture of Russia’s movements and communications into one big, user-friendly picture, employing algorithms to predict where troops are moving and where attacks might happen.

                    But the American experience in Ukraine has underscored how difficult it is to get 21st-century data into 19th-century trenches. Even with Congress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/us/politics/ukraine-new-american-technology.html">on the brink of providing</a> on the brink of providing tens of billions of dollars in aid to Kyiv, mostly in the form of ammunition and long-range artillery, the question remains whether the new technology will be enough to help turn the tide of the war at a moment when the Russians appear to have regained momentum.
